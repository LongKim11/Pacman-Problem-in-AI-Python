# ðŸŸ¡ Pacman Maze Solver with UCS & A* Algorithms

This Python project applies classic AI search algorithms to help Pacman eat **all dots** and visit **all corners** in a maze using **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** and **A Star Search (A\*)**. It includes step-by-step visualization of the solving process.

## ðŸŽ® Project Highlights

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Finds the least costly path by exploring nodes with the lowest cumulative cost first.  
- **A Star Search:** Uses heuristics for faster and more efficient pathfinding.  
- **Visualization:** Real-time tracking of Pacmanâ€™s movement through the maze.  
- **Multi-goal Task:** Pacman must clear all dots and visit every corner.  
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Analyze differences in path length and execution speed between UCS and A*.
